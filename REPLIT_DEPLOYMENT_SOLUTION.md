# Replit Deployment Solution

## Root Cause
Replit's deployment system reads the `.replit` file which contains `npm run dev` in the deployment configuration. This causes deployments to fail because development commands are blocked in production environments.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Deployment Command (Immediate Fix)
Run this command in the Replit shell to deploy manually:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production ./deploy-replit.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Production Server
Use the simplified production configuration:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Deployment Configuration
The project now includes `replit-deployment.config.json` which uses production-ready commands:
- Build: Skips slow build process
- Run: `NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts`

### Option 4: Contact Replit Support
Since the `.replit` file cannot be modified programmatically, contact Replit support to update the deployment configuration to use production commands instead of development commands.

## Why This Happens
- The `.replit` file contains development configuration that cannot be overridden
- Replit's deployment system blocks commands containing 'dev' for security
- The system doesn't automatically switch to production mode

## Verification
After deploying with any of the above methods, verify:
1. The app starts without build errors
2. The health endpoint works: `https://your-app.replit.app/health`
3. The application serves correctly in production mode

## Long-term Fix
Request Replit to update their deployment system to:
1. Allow overriding `.replit` deployment configuration
2. Automatically detect production vs development contexts
3. Use `package.json` production scripts for deployment
