# Deployment Configuration Fix

## Issue
The deployment was failing because the `.replit` file was configured to use development commands (`npm run dev`) instead of production-ready commands.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Production Scripts Created
- `production.js` - Complete production deployment script with build verification
- `build-prod.js` - Standalone build script for production
- `run-production.sh` - Shell script for production deployment

### 2. Manual Configuration Changes Required

Since the `.replit` file cannot be edited programmatically, you need to make these changes manually:

#### In `.replit` file:
```toml
# Change this line:
run = "npm run dev"
# To this:
run = "node production.js"

# And change the deployment section from:
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run dev"]

# To this:
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
build = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build"]
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm start"]
```

#### Alternative deployment commands you can use:
1. `node production.js` - Full production script with build check
2. `./run-production.sh` - Shell script approach
3. `npm run build && npm start` - Simple build and start

### 3. Verification Steps
1. The build process creates files in the `dist/` directory
2. Frontend assets go to `dist/public/`
3. Backend bundle goes to `dist/index.js`
4. Production server runs on port 5000 by default

### 4. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set for production:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (defaults to 5000)
- `DATABASE_URL`
- Any other required environment variables

## Next Steps
1. Update your `.replit` file with the production commands shown above
2. Test the deployment using the new configuration
3. The application will automatically build and start in production mode
