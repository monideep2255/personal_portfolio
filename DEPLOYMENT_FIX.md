# Critical Deployment Fix Required

## Issue
Your Netlify deployment is still using the old database configuration with WebSocket connections, which fails in serverless environments.

## Root Cause
The deployed code hasn't been updated with the HTTP adapter fix for Neon database connections.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Push Updated Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Neon database HTTP adapter for serverless"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Force Redeploy in Netlify
- Go to Netlify Dashboard → Your Site
- Click "Deploys" tab
- Click "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"

### 3. Verify Build Settings
In Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Build & Deploy:
- Build command: `chmod +x build-netlify.sh && ./build-netlify.sh`
- Publish directory: `dist/public`
- Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

## What Was Fixed
- Changed from `Pool` + WebSocket to `neon` HTTP adapter
- Updated import from `drizzle-orm/neon-serverless` to `drizzle-orm/neon-http`
- Removed WebSocket dependencies from netlify.toml

## Expected Results After Deploy
- Projects page will show 4 projects
- Contact form will work without 500 errors
- Admin login will function properly
- All API endpoints will return data instead of database errors
