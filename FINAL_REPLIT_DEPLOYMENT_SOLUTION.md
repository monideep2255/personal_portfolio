# FINAL REPLIT DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## The Problem
Replit deployment fails because the `.replit` file contains `npm run dev` which is flagged as a security risk.

## The Working Solution
Use the `app.cjs` file as your deployment command.

## Deployment Steps

1. **In Replit's deployment settings:**
   - Change the run command from `npm run dev` to: `node app.cjs`
   - Set environment variables:
     - `NODE_ENV=production`
     - `PORT=5000`
     - Add your `DATABASE_URL` and other required secrets

2. **Click Deploy**

## What app.cjs Does
- Sets production environment (`NODE_ENV=production`)
- Creates necessary directories (`server/public`)
- Starts the server with proper error handling
- Handles database connection issues gracefully
- Provides clean shutdown on termination

## Verification
The server is now running successfully in production mode. It:
- Starts without build errors
- Serves on port 5000
- Handles static files correctly
- Runs in production environment

## Alternative Commands
If `app.cjs` doesn't work, try these alternatives:
- `node production-server.cjs`
- `node serve.cjs`
- `node main.js`

All of these bypass the .replit "dev" command issue and run in production mode.
