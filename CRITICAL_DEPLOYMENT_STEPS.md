# Critical Deployment Steps - Fix Both Issues

## Current Status
✅ Database connected (117 character URL)  
❌ Projects count: 0 (should be 4)  
❌ Admin login failing  

## Push Updated Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Force project insertion + admin authentication"
git push origin main
```

## After Deployment - Run Setup

Visit: `https://monideep-chakraborti.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/setup`

This will:
1. Clear any existing projects 
2. Insert 4 complete projects with all data
3. Verify admin credentials are accessible
4. Return confirmation with project count

## Test Both Fixes

**1. Projects API**: `https://monideep-chakraborti.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/projects`
Should return array with 4 projects

**2. Admin Login**: `https://monideep-chakraborti.netlify.app/admin/login`
Use your ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables

## Expected Results
- Projects page displays 4 projects with descriptions
- Admin login accepts your credentials
- Website fully functional
