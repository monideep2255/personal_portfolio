# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Problem Solved
The deployment was failing because the `.replit` file contains `npm run dev` in the deployment configuration, which is blocked in production environments for security reasons.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Production Entry Points Created
- **`app.cjs`** - Main production deployment script (CommonJS format)
- **`main.cjs`** - Alternative production entry point
- **`start-production.js`** - Direct production server launcher
- **`replit-deploy.js`** - Smart environment detection script

### 2. Build Configuration Verified
- Existing `package.json` has proper build process
- Build command: `vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist`
- Start command: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`

### 3. Production Environment Setup
- **`.env.production`** - Production environment template
- **`Dockerfile`** - Container deployment configuration
- **`replit.config.json`** - Alternative deployment config
- **`deploy.sh`** - Bash deployment script

### 4. Server Production Readiness
- Health endpoint at `/health` for deployment monitoring
- Production environment detection and configuration
- Static file serving for built frontend
- Proper error handling and logging

## Deployment Instructions

### For Replit Deploy Button
Use these commands in deployment settings:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `node app.cjs`
- **Environment**: `NODE_ENV=production`

### Manual Deployment Commands
Run any of these in the Replit shell:

```bash
# Option 1: Main production script
node app.cjs

# Option 2: Alternative entry point
node main.cjs

# Option 3: Build and start manually
npm run build && npm start

# Option 4: Bash deployment
./deploy.sh
```

### Environment Variables Required
Set these in Replit Secrets:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `SESSION_SECRET` (secure random string)
- Database URL is automatically provided by Replit

## Verification Steps
1. Build completes without errors
2. Health endpoint responds: `/health`
3. Application serves correctly in production mode
4. Database connections work with SSL enabled

All deployment issues have been resolved with multiple fallback options.
