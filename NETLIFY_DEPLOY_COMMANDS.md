# Netlify Deployment - Exact Steps

## ✅ Verified Configuration
- **netlify.toml**: Correct build settings
- **Environment Variables**: All 5 variables set  
- **Database**: 4 projects ready, tables exist
- **Functions**: Fixed HTTP adapter for serverless

## Deploy Commands

Push your changes to trigger deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Netlify serverless functions with HTTP database adapter"
git push origin main
```

## Verify Deployment Works

After deployment, test these URLs:

1. **Debug Check**: https://monideep-chakraborti.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/debug
   - Should show all environment variables as "SET"

2. **Projects API**: https://monideep-chakraborti.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/projects
   - Should return 4 projects from database

3. **Website**: https://monideep-chakraborti.netlify.app/
   - Projects page should display your 4 projects

## Expected Results

✅ **Debug endpoint** returns environment check  
✅ **Projects API** returns JSON array with 4 projects  
✅ **Website loads** without 404 errors  
✅ **Contact form** submits successfully  

Your database contains these 4 projects ready to display once deployment works.
